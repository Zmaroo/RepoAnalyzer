# AI Tools Documentation

This directory contains the core documentation for the AI-powered code analysis tools implemented in the `ai_tools` module.

## Latest Updates

- Integrated asynchronous indexing and error handling in coordination with the indexing and watcher modules.
- Enhanced code understanding and graph analysis capabilities.
- Improved semantic search that combines information from both code and documentation.
- Documentation now aligns with the current implementation in `ai_tools`.

## Features

- Code analysis and understanding
- Semantic search capabilities
- Graph-based code navigation
- Natural language processing for code

## Components

- AST parsing and analysis
- Code embeddings generation
- Graph database integration
- Query processing
- Graph analysis capabilities (see `graph_capabilities.py`)
- **Unified AI Interface** (see `ai_interface.py`)
- Code structure analysis and code understanding (see `code_understanding.py`)
- Semantic search implementation with support for asynchronous processes and database integrations
- Enhanced pattern matching and error handling utilities

## Contents

- `graph_capabilities.py` - Comprehensive documentation of graph analysis tools
- Additional documentation files may be added for other AI-specific functionality

## Documentation Structure

The documentation in this package follows a consistent format:

1. Overview of capabilities
2. Example usage
3. Schema definitions
4. Available algorithms and tools
5. Query capabilities

## Usage

This documentation package is designed to be read by AI assistants to understand:

- Available analysis capabilities
- How to use each tool effectively
- Data structures and schemas
- Best practices for code analysis

For implementation details, see the corresponding files in the `ai` package.
