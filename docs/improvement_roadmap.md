# RepoAnalyzer Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for improvements to the RepoAnalyzer project, organized by priority and effort level.

## Progress Summary

✅ **File Classification System**: Created a comprehensive classification system that correctly identifies file types and languages.

✅ **Lazy Pattern Loading**: Implemented a system to reduce startup time by loading patterns on demand rather than all at once.

✅ **Pattern Profiling System**: Created a system to identify bottlenecks in pattern compilation and usage.

✅ **Health Monitoring System**: Created a robust health monitoring system for tracking system health, component status, and performance metrics.

✅ **Integration Test Suite**: Created a comprehensive script for running integration tests across all modules with detailed coverage reporting.

✅ **Caching Strategy Document**: Created a detailed document analyzing current caching architecture and recommending improvements.

✅ **Memory-Bounded Cache**: Implemented a memory-bounded cache with size tracking and LRU eviction.

✅ **Cache Monitoring Tool**: Created a CLI tool for monitoring cache usage and managing cache settings.

✅ **Cache Warming System**: Implemented a proactive cache warming system with specialized warming strategies.

✅ **Tree-sitter Block Extraction**: Replaced heuristic block extraction with tree-sitter AST traversal for more accurate code block identification.

✅ **Statistical Pattern Analysis**: Implemented pattern statistics collection and analysis to identify the most valuable patterns and performance bottlenecks.

✅ **Request-Level Caching**: Implemented a request-scoped cache to avoid redundant work during a single analysis request.

## Current Priorities for Next Steps

1. **Error Reporting Improvements** (Medium Priority): Enhance error reporting for better troubleshooting.

2. **Timeouts and Circuit Breakers** (Medium Priority): Add timeouts for all external operations and circuit breakers for error conditions.

3. **Service Recovery** (Medium Priority): Implement automatic service recovery from failure states.
