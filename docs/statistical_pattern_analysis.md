# Statistical Pattern Analysis

## Overview

The Statistical Pattern Analysis feature in RepoAnalyzer provides tools to collect, analyze, and optimize pattern usage across repositories. By tracking pattern execution metrics, this system helps identify which patterns are most valuable, which ones are performance bottlenecks, and provides actionable recommendations for improving overall system performance.

## Purpose

Pattern analysis serves several key purposes:

1. **Performance Optimization** - Identify which patterns are slow or inefficient
2. **Value Assessment** - Determine which patterns provide the most value in code analysis
3. **Resource Allocation** - Guide caching strategies based on pattern usage
4. **Pattern Development** - Provide insights to improve existing patterns and develop new ones

## Architecture

The feature consists of several components:

1. **Pattern Statistics Manager** (`analytics/pattern_statistics.py`) - Core component that collects and analyzes metrics
2. **Pattern Processor Integration** (`parsers/pattern_processor.py`) - Hooks in the pattern processor to collect metrics
3. **Analysis CLI Tool** (`scripts/analyze_patterns.py`) - Command-line interface for working with pattern statistics

### Metrics Collected

For each pattern execution, the system tracks:

- **Execution Time** - How long the pattern took to execute
- **Compilation Time** - Time spent compiling the pattern
- **Match Count** - Number of matches found
- **Memory Usage** - Estimated memory usage
- **Language** - The programming language the pattern is for
- **Pattern Type** - The type of pattern (code structure, naming convention, etc.)

### Calculated Metrics

Based on raw data, the system calculates:

- **Hit Ratio** - Percentage of executions that result in matches
- **Average Execution Time** - Mean execution time across all runs
- **Value Score** - Composite metric that balances hit ratio and execution time

## Using the Analysis Tool

The `analyze_patterns.py` CLI tool provides several commands for working with pattern statistics:

### Analyze Command

Analyze collected pattern statistics and generate insights:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py analyze [--output FILENAME] [--verbose]
```

This generates an analysis of all collected pattern data, including:

- Pattern statistics by language
- Pattern statistics by pattern type
- Most valuable patterns
- Performance bottlenecks
- Optimization recommendations

### Show Command

Display pattern statistics in various formats:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py show --by [language|type|value|bottleneck] [--top N]
```

Options:

- `--by language` - Group statistics by programming language
- `--by type` - Group statistics by pattern type
- `--by value` - Show patterns sorted by value score
- `--by bottleneck` - Show patterns identified as performance bottlenecks
- `--top N` - Limit output to top N patterns (default: 10)

### Recommendations Command

Get actionable recommendations for pattern optimization:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py recommendations [--output FILENAME]
```

Recommendations may include:

- Patterns to prioritize for caching
- Patterns to optimize or remove
- Languages to focus on for pattern development

### Visualize Command

Generate visualizations of pattern statistics:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py visualize [--output FILENAME]
```

Creates a visualization with multiple charts showing pattern performance metrics.

### Export Command

Export all pattern statistics to a JSON file:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py export [--output FILENAME]
```

### Cache Warming Command

Generate recommendations for cache warming based on pattern value:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py warm [--output FILENAME]
```

### Pattern Command

Show detailed metrics for a specific pattern:

```bash
./scripts/analyze_patterns.py pattern PATTERN_ID [--language LANG] [--type TYPE]
```

## Integration with Application Code

Pattern statistics are automatically collected during pattern processing. The `pattern_processor.py` file has been modified to track metrics for each pattern execution.

### How Statistics Collection Works

1. When a pattern is executed, the `process_node` method in `PatternProcessor` measures execution time
2. Pattern information and metrics are sent to the `PatternStatisticsManager`
3. The manager aggregates and stores these metrics for later analysis

### Configuration

Pattern statistics collection can be enabled or disabled by setting the `PATTERN_STATS_ENABLED` flag in `parsers/pattern_processor.py`.

## Visualization

The visualization capabilities provide insights through multiple charts:

- Value score by pattern type
- Execution time vs. hit ratio scatter plot
- Hit ratio by language
- Pattern count by language and type

## Cache Warming Integration

Pattern statistics directly inform cache warming strategies by identifying:

- High-value patterns that should be prioritized for caching
- Language-specific patterns that are frequently used
- Patterns with good hit ratios that would benefit from proactive warming

## Example Workflow

A typical workflow for using pattern analysis might look like:

1. Run the system with pattern statistics collection enabled
2. Process a representative set of repositories
3. Analyze the collected statistics: `./scripts/analyze_patterns.py analyze`
4. Get recommendations: `./scripts/analyze_patterns.py recommendations`
5. Generate cache warming suggestions: `./scripts/analyze_patterns.py warm`
6. Optimize patterns based on insights
7. Update caching strategies to prioritize high-value patterns

## Best Practices

- **Regular Analysis**: Run analysis periodically as pattern usage evolves
- **Benchmarking**: Compare pattern performance before and after optimizations
- **Focused Optimization**: Prioritize optimizing patterns with high usage but poor performance
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use pattern statistics to guide development priorities

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the pattern analysis system:

- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Pattern correlation analysis
- Automatic pattern optimization suggestions
- Machine learning to predict pattern value
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for continuous monitoring
